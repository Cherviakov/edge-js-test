### Overiview

In this repo I try to run c# code from node using library edge-js.
I'm working on linux ubuntu 16.04 and have mono 6.10.0 and dotnet
3.1.401.

Original task was to run c# code from electron + webpack stack on
windows, which, thanks to heavens, successfully worked. On linux
though running even hello world script end up with segfault, therefore
I decided to look into few examples how I can actually make it work.
